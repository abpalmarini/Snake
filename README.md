# snake_ai
I wanted to challenge myself first, to build the classic snake game without any help
from Google (and without having ever seen code for some other snake game) and
secondly, train an AI from scratch, with no libraries, to play the game.

This might not be the efficient way to build the classic snake game, but I
succeeded in my challenge and built everything alone completely from scratch. Even
the graphics didn't come from Google, and were made by my brother!

(PS: After downloading and trying a bunch of other mobile snake games, I noticed mine
runs much smoother. So, actually, maybe it's an even more efficient way than normal :P).

View it on the Google Play Store.
