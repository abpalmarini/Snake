# Snake
I wanted to challenge myself first, to build the classic snake game without any help from Google (and without having ever seen code for some other snake game) and secondly, train an AI from scratch, with no libraries, to play the game.

This might not be the efficient way to build the classic snake game, but I succeeded in my challenge and built everything alone completely from scratch. Even the graphics/sprites didn't come from Google, and were made by my brother!

P.S. After downloading and trying a bunch of other mobile snake games, I noticed mine runs much smoother than several others. So, actually, maybe it is an even more efficient way than normal ðŸ˜Š.

View it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.palmatoro.snakeai). (Note that the Play Store version does not contain any of the AI material).

## AI
* You can view my rule based AI model that I built [here](lib/ai/better_ai.dart). It does really well and currently has a record of 67 apples. 
* To read about my neural network / genetic algorithm approach see [genetic_algorithm.md](lib/ai/genetic_algorithm)
