# Snake

My mobile implementation of the classic Snake game. This was really built as a learning challenge for myself and to see what I thought of making games. While it didn't get me excited in making games, I did play around with building some simple [AI algorithms](lib/ai/better_ai.dart) that got me extremely interested in learning as much as I could about AI.

View it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.palmatoro.snakeai).

(All sprites and graphics were made by my brother).
